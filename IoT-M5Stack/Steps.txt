Step-1
Connect your M5stack Core2 with the sensor module
sensor module includes sensors for Temperature, Pressure & Humidity


Step-2
Turn on the device and connect with the Wifi SSID


Step-3
Programming the Device(M5stack Core2) as per the attached image

*Provide your WiFi SSID and Password
*If you want you can change the time server if  you want (ntp is selected)
*Under host Provide the end point of the AWS IoT core
*Under Key file Select the generated key file from AWS IoT
*Under cert file select the generated certificates from Aws IoT



Create a Thing in Aws IoT with auto generated values for certificates, public and private key along with the root-ca certificates

Generate Policy for the Certificate following the below syntax
arn:aws:iot:<region-name>:<Account-ID>:*

For Policy Action Allow all actions on AWS IoT specifying a *(wild card)

* Test the MQTT Client with subscribing to the m5core2_telemetry topic

(If Successful proceed with the below steps)



In IoT rule:

Create a rule to push push all incoming messages from the Aws IoT to TimeStream Database

Select * from '<topic name>'(Should be enclosed with single quotes)

Specify the Time Stream DB and Table to push data into



Create a Aws TimeStream Database & create a table under it 

While Creating Table you can set the retention period of the Data.



Create a user in AWS Single Sign on which will allow that user to access particular application in the AWS

Provision a AWS Grafana Workspace & the Assign the above user to the workspace
